The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as fish-men and merfolk (two races of fish/human hybrids), dwarves, minks (a race of humanoids with animal features), and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line,[Jp 4] which is also the only continent in the world.[2] The Grand Line,[Jp 5] a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue,[Jp 6] East Blue,[Jp 7] West Blue,[Jp 8] and South Blue.[Jp 9][3] Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts,[Jp 10] similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings.[Jp 11] Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line.
